## Set operations



| | |
| --- | --- |
| [interval_diff](interval_diff.qmd#genominterv.interval_diff) | This function computes the difference between two sets of genomic intervals. |
| [interval_union](interval_union.qmd#genominterv.interval_union) | This function computes the union of two sets of genomic intervals. The genomic intervals |
| [interval_intersect](interval_intersect.qmd#genominterv.interval_intersect) | This function computes the intersection of two sets of genomic intervals. The genomic intervals |
| [interval_collapse](interval_collapse.qmd#genominterv.interval_collapse) | This function computes the union of intervals in a single set. |
| [proximity_test](proximity_test.qmd#genominterv.proximity_test) | Test for proximity of intervals to a set of annotations. |
| [jaccard](jaccard.qmd#genominterv.jaccard) | Compute Jaccard overlap test statistic. |
