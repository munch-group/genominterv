*genomeinterv* provides support for working with intervals on genomes. A genomic interval is specified as a chromosome, start, and end. It is half-open so that a value `x` is in an interval `(start, end)` included in the inrval if `start <= x and x < end`. All functions take pandas.DataFrame as arguments. These data frames must include `chrom`, `start`, and `end` columns.

See the [the library reference](../api/) for detailed documentation of each function and decorator.
