## Proximity

[](`~genominterv.proximity_test`) computes tests if intervals in one set is significantly
proximal to intervals in another set.


## Overlap

[](`~genominterv.jaccard`) computes the [Jaccard index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index)
statistic for two sets of genomic intervals.


This can be combined with the [](`~genominterv.bootstrap`) decorator to produce a test for overlap. The decorator turns a function producing
a statistic into one that also produces a p-value. The bootstrapping resamples
the intervals of the second argument for each chromosome independently. Only
required argument to bootstrap is the name of the chromosome assembly used.

```python
@bootstrap('hg19', samples=1000)
def jaccard_test(query, annot):
    return jaccard(query, annot)

jaccard_stat, p_value = jaccard_test(intervals, other_intervals)
```

The decorator works on any function that takes two sets of intervals.
