The three functions, [](`~genominterv.interval_diff`), [](`~genominterv.interval_intersect`), and [](`~genominterv.interval_union`), do the standard difference, intersection and union set operations on two sets of genomic intervals. The intervals returned from all three functions are collapsed to produce non-overlapping intervals. The genomic intervals in each set must be non-overlapping. This can be achieved using the [](`~genominterv.interval_collapse`) function, which produces the union of genomic intervals in a single set genomic ofintervals.

```python
